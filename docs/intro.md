# OpenMC depletion V&V.

This is a book contains comparison of OpenMC depletion results with open benchmarks.

Open benchmarks offer a higher level of reproducibility and ease of integration compared to closed benchmarks and are therefore the focus of this book. 

Currently the [CoNDERC Dataset of FNS Fusion Decay-Heat Benchmark](https://www-nds.iaea.org/conderc/fusion/) produced by the IAEA is the main benchmark included.

CoNDERC is an extensive benchmark suit and the FNS Fusion Decay-Heat Benchmark dataset includes irradiation of 69 elements and 4 materials with three difference irradiation campaign at the FNS facility.

The experimental results along with code to code comparisons can be found below.
