# OpenMC depletion V&V.

This book presents a comprehensive comparison of OpenMC depletion calculations against established open benchmarks.

Open benchmarks provide superior reproducibility and seamless integration capabilities compared to proprietary alternatives, making them the primary focus of this comparative study.

The analysis centers on the [CoNDERC Dataset from the IAEA’s FNS Fusion Decay-Heat Benchmark](https://www-nds.iaea.org/conderc/fusion/), which represents one of the most comprehensive validation datasets available in the field. This extensive benchmark suite encompasses experimental data from the irradiation of 69 individual elements and 4 composite materials across three distinct irradiation campaigns conducted at the FNS facility.

The following chapters detail both the experimental results and systematic code-to-code comparisons, providing readers with thorough validation data for OpenMC’s depletion capabilities and insights into its performance relative to other computational approaches.
